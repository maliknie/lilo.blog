# Who Am I?

Hello! My name is Malik, and I'm currently a student at Gymnasium Kirchenfeld in Switzerland, Bern. I finished the lower secondary school in a progymnasial class at the OS Kerzers in Canton Freiburg, which laid the foundation for my academic journey.
As a major in physics and applied mathematics, I have a passion for learning and exploring these fields. Additionally, I'm excited to delve into the realm of computer science and software development. I'm currently honing my skills in Python programming and learning about web development, including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
Beyond academics, I have a passion for sports. One of my main athletic pursuits is volleyball and I’m proud to be part of the 20 unders team at Vopap. 
Apart from sports, my interests revolve around mathematics, computer science, and programming. I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding creative solutions. Exploring the world of programming allows me to combine my logical thinking skills with my passion for innovation.
Looking ahead, my aspirations lie in pursuing higher education at ETH Zürich, where I aim to study computer science or engineering. I am eager to contribute to the ever-evolving technological landscape and make a positive impact through innovative ideas and solutions.
